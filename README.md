**Fine-Tuning LLaMA 2 Model**
==============================================

**Introduction**
---------------
This repository contains the code and instructions for fine-tuning the LLaMA 2 model using the Hugging Face library.

**About Llama 2**
---------------
LLaMA 2 is a powerful language model developed by Meta AI that achieves state-of-the-art results in various natural language processing tasks. This repository provides a simple and efficient way to fine-tune the LLaMA 2 model on your custom dataset using the Hugging Face Transformers library.

**Prerequisites**
-------------------
* Python 3.8+
* Pytorch 1.12+
* Hugging Face Transformers library
* Hugging Face Datasets library
* Hugging Face CLI
* LoRA
* QLoRA

**Configuring the Fine-Tuning Script**
-------------------
You can customize the fine-tuning process by modifying the hyperparameters and settings :

MODEL_NAME: The name of the LLaMA 2 model to fine-tune (e.g. "llama-2-base").
DATASET_NAME: The name of the dataset used for fine-tuning.
BATCH_SIZE: The batch size used for training.
NUM_EPOCHS: The number of epochs to train the model.
LEARNING_RATE: The learning rate used for training.
